    <contents>It was chilly in New York and Boston but Tuesday turned out to be a nearly perfect day to celebrate St. Patrick's Day in Savannah, Georgia, where the South's biggest celebration of the Irish holiday began 191 years ago.

By the time the parade kicked off at 10:15 a.m., thermometers were pushing 79 degrees. Matt Gray, who recently moved from Maryland, came to his first Savannah parade wearing a kilt. "It's amazing," he said.

    <contents>Travelers at Boston's Logan International Airport got an early taste of St. Patrick's Day on Monday when the Dropkick Murphys staged an impromptu performance.

The band, en route to Ireland for a tour, set up in international Terminal E and let it rip.

The band played a rousing rendition of its hit, "I'm Shipping up to Boston," altering the lyrics slightly to "I'm Shipping up to Dublin."</contents>

    <contents>At a barracks in Aldershot, England, Prince William and his pregnant wife, Kate, presented shamrocks to soldiers from the Irish Guards, one of the two Irish-recruited regiments in the British Army.

Kate, 33, handed out baskets of shamrocks and pinned a sprig on the collar of the regiment's mascot, an Irish wolfhound called Domhnall. The 3-year-old dog was treated to a sip of Guinness at the ceremony's end.
